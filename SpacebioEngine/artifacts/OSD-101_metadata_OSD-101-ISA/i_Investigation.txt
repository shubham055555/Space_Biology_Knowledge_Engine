Study Title	Rodent Research-1 (RR1) NASA Validation Flight: Mouse left gastrocnemius muscle transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenomic data
Study Description	NASA's Rodent Research (RR) project is playing a critical role in advancing biomedical research on the physiological effects of space environments. Due to the limited resources for conducting biological experiments aboard the International Space Station (ISS), it is imperative to use crew time efficiently while maximizing high-quality science return. NASA's GeneLab project has as its primary objectives to 1) further increase the value of these experiments using a multi-omics, systems biology-based approach, and 2) disseminate these data without restrictions to the scientific community. The current investigation assessed viability of RNA, DNA, and protein extracted from archived RR-1 tissue samples for epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic assays. During the first RR spaceflight experiment (RR-1), a variety of tissue types were harvested from subjects, snap-frozen or RNAlater-preserved, and then stored at least a year at -80C after return to Earth. They were then prioritized for this investigation based on likelihood of significant scientific value for spaceflight research. All tissues were made available to GeneLab through the bio-specimen sharing program managed by the Ames Life Science Data Archive and included mouse adrenal glands, quadriceps, gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, extensor digitorum longus, soleus, eye, and kidney. We report here protocols for and results of these tissue extractions, and thus, the feasibility and value of these kinds of omics analyses. In addition to providing additional opportunities for investigation of spaceflight effects on the mouse transcriptome and proteome in new kinds of tissues, our results may also be of value to program managers for the prioritization of ISS crew time for rodent research activities.

Study Protocol Description	A cohort of 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice were flown to the ISS, housed in the Rodent Habitat and were subjected to microgravity for 37 days. Mice of simiar age, sex and strain were used for ground controls housed in identical hardware and matching ISS environmental conditions. The mice were euthanized by ISS crew with Euthasol injection followed by cervical dislocation, frozen in a pre-chilled Mini Cold Bag (MCB) before transfer to the MELFI freezer (-80 C) and brought back to Earth. The study followed recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the protocol was approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).	The mouse carcasses were removed from -80 C storage and thawed at room temperature for 15-20 minutes.  Multiple tissues, including left gastrocnemius muscle, were collected from each carcass. Total dissection time for each carcass was no longer than 30 minutes since collection of the first tissue. Left gastrocnemius muscle was harvested, cut in half with a scalpel, and snap frozen separately with liquid nitrogen.	TRIzol: After thawing on ice and using a scalpel, approximately 1/3 of total gastrocnemius tissue was weighed and immediately placed in 1 ml of the TRIzol solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged at 12,000 X g for 10 minutes at 4 C to remove cell debris. The supernatant from each sample was then used to isolate RNA following the manufacturer protocol. The isolated RNA was then purified on column with DNAse I (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valenica, CA). The purified RNA was eluted in 30 uL H2O. Concentration and absorbance ratios for RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).  PrepEase: After thawing on ice and using a scalpel, approximately 1/3 of tissue was weighed and immediately placed in 300 ul of the homogenization buffer included in the PrepEase Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (USB, Cleveland, OH) and DNA isolation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA pellets were resuspended in 50 ul of DNA Resuspension Buffer. Concentration and absorbance ratios for DNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).	RNA methylation analysis was performed by Epigentek Group Inc. 60 samples of Total mouse gastrocnemius RNA was prepared by GeneLab and received by Epigentek. The samples were subjected to bisulfite conversion, cDNA reverse transcription, library preparation, Bioanalyzer QC, KAPA library quantification, multiplex NGS on an Illumina HiSeq2500 and advanced data analysis.  Bisulfite Conversion: RNA samples were bisulfite treated with the Methylamp RNA Bisulfite Conversion Kit Kit (Epigentek Cat.   P-9003). 200 ng for the samples N1, N2, N4 through N12, and N37 through N60. 100 ng for the samples N3 and N13 through N36.  Library Preparation: -cDNA was synthesized from bisulfite treated RNA and ligated with adaptors by using random probing method. -Library amplification was performed using indexed primers and library cDNA was purified with magnetic beads -Purified library cDNA was eluted in 12 uL of water.  Library QC: Library construction was verified on a Bioanalyzer and KAPA Library Quantification.	5 nM of sample libraries were subjected to next generation sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 in Single Read 50 nts format.	Data analysis was performed by Epigentek, and the detailed analysis workflow is provided in the Supplemental Materials.	For protein homogenization the urea based protein lysis buffer consisted of 8M urea, with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, at pH 8.5 in DNase- and RNase-free H2O and was custom ordered (Teknova, Hollister, CA). This recipe was initially provided by Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS). Protease inhibitors, 1:100 of 0.1 M phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride solution in ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) and 1:100 of complete EDTA-free tablets (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), were added to the lysis buffer kept on ice. After thawing on ice and using a scalpel, approximately 1/3 of total gastrocnemius tissue was weighed and immediately added to 650 uL protein lysis buffer. Each sample was homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY). Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4 C and at 14,000 X g to remove cell debris. A 30 uL sample of each supernatant was kept on ice for total protein concentration assay, and the rest of the supernatant was snap-frozen with liquid nitrogen in aliquots. The Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) was used to measure the total protein concentration of each protein sample.	Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the following SUMS protocol:  25 uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0 was added to each sample, followed by 1.5 uL of 500mM DTT, incubated at 50C for 30 minutes and cooled to room temperature. 3 uL of 1M propionamide was added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 1hr. 75 uL of 50mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.02% protease max was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ug of trypsin/lysC (Promega) and overnight incubation at 37C.  10 uL of 10% formic acid, 90% water was added to each sample to quench the digest. The samples were incubated at 37C for 10 minutes, followed by centrifugation at 10,000g for 5 minutes. Microspin C18 columns (NEST group, p/n SEM SS18V) were equilibrated with acetonitrile followed by 2 times wash with 0.1% formic acid/water and each sample was cleaned and concentrated independently per vendor protocol. The eluant peptides were dried in a speed vac to less than 2 uL volume and stored at 4C prior to TMT isobaric labeling. Each peptide pool was reconstituted in 100 uL, 100mM HEPES, pH 8.0. The TMT isobaric labels were reconstituted in 40 uL absolute ethyl alcohol and 20 uL of each isobaric tag as described above was added to the corresponding sample. The samples incubated at room temperature for 1.5hr, followed by the addition of 5 uL hydroxylamine to quench the reaction. 50 uL of each isobaric-tagged peptide pool was drawn and pooled to a final volume of 500 uL, 500 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to a final volume of 1mL. This fraction (around 250 ug total peptide) was purified on a Water Oasis HLB 3cc C18 cartridge per vendor protocol and the final eluent dried to completion in a speed vac. SCX offline fractionation was performed using a Protea SCX column (p/n SP-155) and the provided buffers. In brief, the previously dried 10plex peptide pool was dissolved in 150 uL reconstitution solution and loaded onto the equilibrated SCX column (3 times) followed by 2 sequential washes. The elution solution provided in the kit was diluted in series to 50mM, 100mM, 150mM, 200mM, 300mM and 400mM (stock) concentrations. The peptides were then eluted starting with the 50mM salt concentration and collected in a new tube for the entire series. 200 uL of 0.1% formic acid water was added to each SCX eluted fraction and each was Microspin C18 purified as previously described. Each fraction was reconstituted in 20 uL 0.2% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile, 97.8% water and injected for liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis.  Samples were divided in two TMT 10-plex labeling groups. Run 1 includes M23, M24, M25, M33, M34 and M35, and Run 2 includes M26, M27, M28, M36, M37, M38. Both runs also include four pooled samples: pool of all flight samples, pool of all ground control samples, pool of all flight and ground control samples and one empty channel.	Samples were processed at the Stanford University Mass Spectrometry (SUMS) omics core facility using the Thermo Orbitrap Fusion MS.

The DNA pellets were resuspended in 50 ul of DNA Resuspension Buffer. Concentration and absorbance ratios for DNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).	RNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center using the Illumina TruSeq stranded RNA library prep kit after ribo-depletion. The libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubit measurements.	The RNA library sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. The libraries were sequenced across two sequencing runs at 100bp and 150bp paired end reads. Performed by UC Davis Genome Center.	Raw fastq files from each sample were assessed for % rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version 1.0.0) screened against a fasta file of Mus musculus rRNA sequences retrieved from NCBI on 01-Sep-2021. Raw fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1) and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports.	Data were processed as described in GL-DPPD-7101-G (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/master/RNAseq/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7101_Versions/GL-DPPD-7101-G.md), using NF_RCP version 2.0.0 (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/tree/NF_RCP-2.0.0/RNAseq/Workflow_Documentation/NF_RCP). In short, raw fastq files were filtered using Trim Galore! (version 0.6.10) powered by Cutadapt (version 4.2). Trimmed fastq file quality was evaluated with FastQC (version 0.12.1), and MultiQC (version 1.26) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Mus Musculus STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version 2.7.11b) and RSEM (version 1.3.3), respectively, Ensembl release 112, genome assembly GRCm39 (Mus_musculus.GRCm39.dna.primary_assembly.fa) and the following gtf annotation file: Mus_musculus.GRCm39.112.gtf. Trimmed reads were aligned to the Mus Musculus STAR reference with STAR (version 2.7.11b) and alignment log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). Aligned reads were assessed for strandedness using RSeQC infer_experiment.py (version 5.0.4), gene body coverage using RSeQC geneBody_coverage.py (version 5.0.4), inner distance was assessed using RSeQC inner_distance.py (version 5.0.4), and distribution of RNA features using RSeQC read_distribution.py (version 5.0.4). Aligned reads from all samples were quantified using RSEM (version 1.3.3), with strandedness set to reverse and RSEM count log files were compiled with MultiQC (version 1.26). To create a set of rRNA-removed quantification data, Ensembl IDs mapping to ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were removed from the RSEM gene count data. Both the original set of RSEM quantification data and the rRNA-removed data were subject to differential gene expression analysis as follows. A runsheet was generated with dp_tools (version 1.3.5) and the runsheet and quantification data were imported to R (version 4.4.2) with tximport (version 1.34.0) and normalized with DESeq2 (version 1.46.0) median of ratios method. Normalized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Differential expression analysis was performed in R (version 4.4.2) using DESeq2 (version 1.46.0); all groups were compared pairwise using the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the F statistic p-value. Gene annotations were assigned using the custom annotation tables generated in-house as detailed in GL-DPPD-7110-A (https://github.com/nasa/GeneLab_Data_Processing/blob/GL_RefAnnotTable-A_1.1.0/GeneLab_Reference_Annotations/Pipeline_GL-DPPD-7110_Versions/GL-DPPD-7110-A/GL-DPPD-7110-A.md), with STRINGdb (version 2.16.4), PANTHER.db (version 1.0.12), and org.Mm.eg.db (version 3.19.1).	TRIzol: After thawing on ice and using a scalpel, approximately 1/3 of total gastrocnemius tissue was weighed and immediately placed in 1 ml of the TRIzol solution. Each sample was then homogenized for approximately 20 seconds at 21,000 RPM using a Polytron PT1300D handheld homogenizer with a 5 mm standard dispersing aggregate tip (Kinematica, Bohemia, NY).

The isolated RNA was then purified on column with DNAse I (Qiagen, Valenica, CA) and RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valenica, CA). The purified RNA was eluted in 30 uL H2O. Concentration and absorbance ratios for RNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit or Agilent RNA 6000 Pico Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).  PrepEase: After thawing on ice and using a scalpel, approximately 1/3 of tissue was weighed and immediately placed in 300 ul of the homogenization buffer included in the PrepEase Genomic DNA Isolation Kit (USB, Cleveland, OH) and DNA isolation was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. The DNA pellets were resuspended in 50 ul of DNA Resuspension Buffer. Concentration and absorbance ratios for DNA samples were measured using the NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).	DNA sequencing library construction was performed by UC Davis Genome Center. Aliquots of each DNA sample was bisulfite-converted with the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (Zymo Research). Sequencing libraries was generated from the converted DNA sample with the EpiGnome Methyl-Seq kit (Epicentre). The resulting libraries were QC-ed by bioanalyzer and quantified by fluorometric Qubic measurements and RT-PCR.	The BS-sequencing was performed on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 at UC Davis Genome Center. Each library was sequenced on one HiSeq lane by itself with paired end 150bp reads.
